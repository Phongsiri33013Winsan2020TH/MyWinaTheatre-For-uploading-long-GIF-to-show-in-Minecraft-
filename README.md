# MyWinaTheatre (For uploading long GIF to show in Minecraft)

*Note: Sorry, I forgot that file size limit is 25MB each.*

**I suggested to do like an anime that show on Asahi TV every 10 mins. Because it is short.**

**Ex. Drama on TV (1 part of it), short cartoon that show on TV.**

**Because Minecraft role-play city time is shorter than real-life and player may boring if movie without sound.**

Upload in pull request.

Name like this:

Movie-<name>

Intro-<name>

Only GIF accept. (Yes, no sound.)
Because of SlideShow mod can't play MP4.
